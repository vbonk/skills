## Project Context

repo-template is a production-ready GitHub template repository with 7 AI agent configs, 16 workflows, 6-layer security, and 100 automated tests. v1.0.0 is released. This plan covers the path from v1.0.0 to v1.1.0 based on 5 research reports: competitive landscape, OSSF scorecard, top 50 templates, scaffolding UX patterns, and audience analysis.

## Target Audience (Validated)

**Primary:** Solo developers and agentic coders using AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot) who lack professional team GitHub experience. Three personas:
1. **Vibe Coders** (63% non-developers) — largest, fastest-growing segment
2. **Solo Builders** — technical but always worked alone
3. **AI-Augmented Devs** — experienced, new to AI tools

**Key insight:** They've never had a senior engineer set up their repo. The template IS that senior engineer.

**Key stats driving documentation strategy:**
- 29M secrets leaked on GitHub in 2025 (AI commits at 2x leak rate)
- 0/15 AI-built test apps had CSRF protection or security headers
- Adding .env to .gitignore prevents 89% of secret leaks
- They read inline config comments more than documentation files

## Research Reports (in `_admin/research/`)

| Report | File | Key Finding |
|--------|------|-------------|
| R1: AI Ecosystem | r1-ai-ecosystem.md | repo-template has best AI agent coverage (7 agents, closest competitor has 4) |
| R2: OSSF Scorecard | r2-ossf-scorecard.md | Current ~5.8/10, achievable ~8.0 with Tier 1 fixes |
| R3: Top 50 Templates | r3-top-templates.md | Gap: PROD_CHECKLIST, CONTRIBUTORS, commitlint. Strength: security+governance unique |
| R4: Init UX | r4-init-ux.md | "Recommended defaults" meta-prompt, non-interactive mode needed |
| R5: Audience | audience-analysis.md | 3 personas validated, security is highest-value education |

## Milestone 2: Init UX + Claude Integration (v1.2.0)

**Goal:** Improve scaffolding UX based on R4 research. Non-interactive mode. Enhanced Claude integration.
**Estimated effort:** 5-6 issues, 3-4 hours

### Issue 2.1: "Recommended Defaults" Meta-Prompt

**Objective:** Add a 1-question shortcut to init-template that collapses Quick Mode.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Update .claude/commands/init-template.md
- [ ] First question: "Quick setup with recommended defaults? (Y/n)"
- [ ] If Y: auto-fill with Node.js/TypeScript defaults, run secure-repo.sh + hooks
- [ ] If n: proceed with current interactive flow

### Issue 2.2: Non-Interactive Flag Mode

**Objective:** Support fully non-interactive scaffolding for CI/automation.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `scripts/init-project.sh` — CLI wrapper for init-template
- [ ] Flags: `--name`, `--stack`, `--description`, `--no-interactive`
- [ ] Calls secure-repo.sh and setup-hooks.sh automatically

### Issue 2.3: Scratchpad / Working Memory

**Objective:** Add `.claude/scratchpad.md` pattern (from R1: devin.cursorrules).

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `.claude/scratchpad.md` template
- [ ] Reference in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Add to .gitignore (working memory is local-only)

### Issue 2.4: Update Audit + Test + Release

- Same as 1.9/1.10 pattern

---

## Milestone 3: Distribution (v2.0.0)

**Goal:** CLI tool + monorepo variant.
**Issues:** #75 (CLI), #79 (Monorepo)
**Estimated effort:** Significant — separate planning needed

---

## Execution Strategy

### Parallel Execution Plan

```
Batch A (parallel — no file conflicts):
  Issue 1.1 (Sigstore)     → modifies: release.yml
  Issue 1.4 (PROD_CHECKLIST) → creates: docs/PROD_CHECKLIST.md
  Issue 1.6 (.claude dirs)  → creates: .claude/skills/, .claude/agents/
  Issue 1.7 (Commitlint)    → creates: templates/linting/commitlint.config.js.template

Batch B (parallel — no file conflicts):
  Issue 1.2 (SBOM)          → modifies: release.yml (AFTER 1.1 merges)
  Issue 1.5 (CONTRIBUTORS)  → creates: CONTRIBUTORS.md, new workflow
  Issue 1.8 (Conflicts)     → creates: new workflow

Batch C (sequential — touches shared files):
  Issue 1.3 (OSSF Badge)    → modifies: README.md (human step)
  Issue 1.9 (Counts)        → modifies: test-template.sh, audit-compliance.sh, README.md
  Issue 1.10 (Docs)         → modifies: CHANGELOG.md, memory, release
```

### Testing Strategy

Each issue runs: `bash scripts/test-template.sh`
After each batch: `bash scripts/test-template.sh && bash scripts/test-e2e.sh`
Before release: Full E2E including repo creation

### Documentation Checkpoints

| After | Update |
|-------|--------|
| Batch A complete | Commit, update CHANGELOG draft |
| Batch B complete | Commit, run compliance audit |
| Batch C complete | Full docs pass, MCP memory, release |

---

## Quality Gates

Every issue must pass before closing:

1. **Code quality:** ShellCheck passes, YAML valid, Actions SHA-pinned
2. **Tests pass:** `bash scripts/test-template.sh` — 0 failures
3. **DOD verified:** Every checkbox in the issue's Definition of Done checked
4. **No regressions:** Existing test count doesn't decrease
5. **Docs updated:** README, CHANGELOG, relevant docs reflect changes
